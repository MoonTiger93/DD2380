_Question 1 This problem can be formulated in matrix form. Please specify the initial probability
vector π, the transition probability matrix A and the observation probability matrix B._

Answer 1

π = 
[0.5, 0.5]

A =
[0.5, 0.5;
 0.5, 0.5]
 
B =
[0.9,0.1;
 0.5,0.5]

_Question 2 What is the result of this operation?_

[0.5,0.5]

_Question 3 What is the result of this operation?_

"this shows the probability of showing each result {head,tail}"

[0.7,0.3]

_tested this same matrix multiplication on kattis_


_Question 4 Why is it valid to substitute O1:t = o1:t with Ot = ot
for when we condition on the
state Xt = xi?_



_Question 5 How many values are stored in the matrices δ and δ
i d x respectively?_
